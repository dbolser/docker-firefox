I don't know how to do this better... there is probably a way...

    # Dump out your xauth cookies
    xauth list > xauth.list`

    # Build via compose (although I don't suppose it makes a difference)
    docker-compose build
    
    # Lunch firefox
    docker-compose up
    
Now to fix fonts...
